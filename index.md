If all tests have passed, you can merge your changes into the master branch. If the tests fail, look at the comments of the pull request to find out what the problem was. Fix the errors so that the tests pass. A good idea is to repeat the steps of the issue again and see if everything is written correctly. You can also look at the Index.md file
